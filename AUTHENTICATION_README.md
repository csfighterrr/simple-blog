# Simple Blog - Enhanced User Authentication System

This project has been updated with a comprehensive user authentication system that allows all users to register, login, and create blog posts. The admin-only restriction has been removed, making it a true multi-user blogging platform.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

### User Authentication
- **User Registration**: New users can sign up with email, password, and optional display name
- **User Login**: Existing users can sign in with email and password
- **User Profiles**: Each user has a profile with display name, bio, and website
- **Secure Authentication**: Built on Supabase Auth with Row Level Security (RLS)

### Blog Functionality
- **Create Posts**: All authenticated users can create and publish blog posts
- **Edit Posts**: Users can edit their own posts
- **Public Reading**: Anyone can read published posts
- **Draft System**: Users can save posts as drafts before publishing

### Enhanced UI/UX
- **Unified Auth Form**: Single component with tabs for login and registration
- **Profile Management**: Rich profile editing with display name, bio, and website
- **Author Attribution**: Posts show author's display name or username
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices

## ðŸ“‹ Database Schema Updates

### New Tables

#### Profiles Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE profiles (
  id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE PRIMARY KEY,
  display_name TEXT,
  bio TEXT,
  avatar_url TEXT,
  website TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### Auto-Profile Creation
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public.profiles (id, display_name)
  VALUES (NEW.id, COALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'display_name', split_part(NEW.email, '@', 1)));
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
  AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user();
```
